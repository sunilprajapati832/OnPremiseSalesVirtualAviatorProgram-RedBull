# Project: "On Premise Sales Virtual Aviator Program - Red Bull" 
(This project is based on a real-world job simulation by Red Bull and Forage, where I acted as an On-Premise Sales Specialist to analyze sales data, evaluate marketing impact and handle customer objections using data-driven strategies)

## Domain: Marketing | Sales | Retail and Consumer Behavior | Customer Relationship Management (CRM) & Retention | Business Intelligence & Reporting |  Strategic Decision-Making | Sales Enablement & Communication | Operations | Pricing Strategy

This project is part of my "Master Data Analytics Roadmap" series and represents the second real-world analytics project in my journey. I completed the Red Bull On-Premise Sales Job Simulation via Forage, acting as an On-Premise Sales Specialist. The project demonstrates how data analytics empowers marketing and sales decisions, transforming raw sales data into actionable insights and strategies.
In this post:
* I explore how data analysis is a powerful tool in marketing by calculating CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) and sorting accounts by performance, I learned: Which bars, restaurants or venues were growing or underperforming. Marketers use this to focus efforts on high-potential clients and fix declining ones.
* I analyzed how different marketing tools (coolers, posters, digital screens) impacted sales. Found that accounts using 2+ promotional tools saw 15â€“20% better performance. Marketers use this insight to decide where to invest budgetsâ€”what promotions work best.
* I compared average sales with the number of Red Bull products offered (Regular, Sugar Free, Yellow) and Found that more variety = higher sales. Marketers use this kind of analysis to build product bundling, upselling and menu strategies.
* I didnâ€™t just stop at dataâ€”you listened to customer objections (Bar 7 case) and used data + soft skills to reframe objections and pitch solutions. Modern marketing isn't just numbersâ€”it's about understanding people and using insights to guide them.
* I converted raw Excel data into charts, tables and a clear business presentation. Marketers must tell stories with numbers: Why are sales dropping? Whatâ€™s working? What should we try next?

Marketing isnâ€™t just creativeâ€”itâ€™s strategic And strategy needs data. This project proves that data analysts can drive smarter marketing decisions, spot patterns and help brands grow intelligently.
