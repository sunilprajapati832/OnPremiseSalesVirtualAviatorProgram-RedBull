I'm excited to share the second real-world project in my application-focused data analytics journey! In Series: "Master Data Analytics Roadmap"  

"Red Bull On-Premise Sales Job Simulation" by Forage. 

In this post, I explore how data analysis is a powerful tool in marketing.By calculating CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) and sorting accounts by performance, I learned: Which bars, restaurants or venues were growing or underperforming. Marketers use this to focus efforts on high-potential clients and fix declining ones.

I analyzed how different marketing tools (coolers, posters, digital screens) impacted sales. Found that accounts using 2+ promotional tools saw 15‚Äì20% better performance. Marketers use this insight to decide where to invest budgets‚Äîwhat promotions work best.

I compared average sales with the number of Red Bull products offered (Regular, Sugar Free, Yellow) and Found that more variety = higher sales. Marketers use this kind of analysis to build product bundling, upselling and menu strategies.

I didn‚Äôt just stop at data‚Äîyou listened to customer objections (Bar 7 case) and used data + soft skills to reframe objections and pitch solutions. Modern marketing isn't just numbers‚Äîit's about understanding people and using insights to guide them.

I converted raw Excel data into charts, tables and a clear business presentation. Marketers must tell stories with numbers: Why are sales dropping? What‚Äôs working? What should we try next?

Marketing isn‚Äôt just creative‚Äîit‚Äôs strategic And strategy needs data.
This project proves that data analysts can drive smarter marketing decisions, spot patterns and help brands grow intelligently.
